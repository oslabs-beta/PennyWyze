Most teams default to the smartest, most expensive Claude tier because checking whether a cheaper one would work means building a whole test harness — so they never check, and quietly overpay every month.

PennyWyze is that harness, already built. Point it at your real prompt and a handful of examples you know the right answer to; it runs all three Claude tiers against them, grades every answer, prices each tier from real token usage, and tells you the cheapest one that still passes.

**What makes it different:**
- Costs are measured from real API token counts, never estimated
- Grading is strict on purpose — a correct answer wearing decoration passes, a right answer buried in a sentence doesn't
- A tier that's mathematically already failed stops spending immediately, mid-run
- Verdicts held identical across 5 consecutive real audits

## Getting Started

Requires [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/) on macOS, Linux, or Windows.

```bash
npm install -g pennywyze
```

Add your key — get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/), then create a `.env` file wherever you're running the command from:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Write a prompt (`prompt.md`) — the exact instructions your feature already sends to Claude — and a golden dataset: real inputs paired with the answer you know is right.

```jsonl
{"input": "I was charged twice this month", "expected": "billing"}
{"input": "The app crashes on upload", "expected": "technical"}
```

Then run it:

```bash
pennywyze audit --prompt prompt.md --dataset dataset.jsonl --pass-rate 90
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--prompt <filepath>` | yes | — | your instructions file |
| `--dataset <filepath>` | yes | — | your golden dataset |
| `--volume <count>` | no | 100000 | messages/month — scales cost, never the verdict |
| `--pass-rate <percent>` | no | 100 | minimum score to pass, 1–100 |

## How It Grades

Both sides are cleaned first (quotes, casing, code fences, trailing punctuation stripped), then compared **exactly** — not "contains." A decorated correct answer passes; a wrong answer never does, and an answer buried in a sentence fails on purpose, because ignoring "respond with one word" is a real bug in production. The winner is always the *cheapest tier that passed* — never just the cheapest tier.

## Contributing & Development

Contributions are welcome — fork the repo, branch, commit, and open a PR against `main`.

Build from source instead of installing from npm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/PennyWyze.git
cd PennyWyze
npm install
npm run dev -- audit --prompt examples/prompt.md --dataset examples/demo-dataset.jsonl   # run without building
npm test                                                                                  # run the test suite
```

**Developing without an API key or cost:** add `--fake` to any command to run the full pipeline against a free, instant, built-in stand-in provider instead of the real Anthropic API. This is how the tool gets built and tested day to day — real API calls are only for real audits.

**Extending PennyWyze:** the audit loop is built around two swappable contracts — `ModelProvider` (anything that can answer a question and report what it cost, see `src/providers/provider.ts`) and `Scorer` (anything that can grade an answer true or false, see `src/scorers/scorer.ts`). Most new features — a new model provider, a new grading strategy — are a single new file implementing one of these two interfaces, not a change to the core loop.

## Roadmap

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Real audits against live Claude models | ✅ |
| Strict, decoration-tolerant grading | ✅ |
| Early stopping — never pay for a run that's already lost | ✅ |
| Configurable pass bar (`--pass-rate`) | ✅ |
| Real cost projections + audit self-cost | ✅ |
| Free offline `--fake` mode for development | ✅ |
| Published to the npm registry | ✅ |
| Claude Fable 5 as a fourth tier | 🙏🏻 |
| Structured JSON output | 🙏🏻 |
| JSON grading (deterministic, for structured answers) | 🙏🏻 |
| Shareable HTML report | 🙏🏻 |
| GitHub Action — re-audit in CI against a committed baseline | 🙏🏻 |
| Flexible dataset input formats (CSV, etc.) | 🙏🏻 |
| `pennywyze init` — guided golden-dataset builder | 🙏🏻 |
| Cross-provider audits — OpenAI, Google, and Grok, run in parallel per provider | 🙏🏻 |
| LLM-as-judge — exact match runs first, the judge only sees the rest, and reports how often it agrees with your own grading | 🙏🏻 |
| Prompt trimming — cheaper prompts, not just cheaper models | 🙏🏻 |
