# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `--current <model-id>`: names the model you run today, so savings are measured against what you actually pay instead of the most expensive tier audited
- CI on every pull request (typecheck, tests, build) across Node 20 and 22
- Prettier config and `format` / `format:check` scripts

### Fixed
- A failed API call no longer discards the whole audit. The failure is recorded, that model stops, and the remaining models finish
- A truncated or declined response is no longer graded as a wrong answer. Providers report `stop_reason`, and anything other than `end_turn` is recorded as incomplete and excluded from scores, misses and cost
- Opus and Sonnet are no longer billed for reasoning this task never asked for. Effort is set per model from the catalog, and omitted for Haiku 4.5, which rejects the parameter
- Progress labels no longer fall back to "haiku" for unrecognized model ids
- Haiku's model id corrected to the canonical `claude-haiku-4-5`
- Request timeouts are per model (120s for thinking tiers, 60s for Haiku). A single 20s ceiling made slow-but-valid answers look like network failures
- `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` corrected where they described behaviour the code no longer has

### Changed
- Node 20 or newer is required (18 is end-of-life)
- The audit loop no longer writes to the terminal; progress is reported through callbacks, with the rendering in `progress.ts`
- The fake provider is a factory, so tests no longer share answer-list position

## [1.1.0] - 9/22/26

### Added
- `--capture-misses <filepath>`: opt-in capture of wrong answers as grader fixtures, written only to the path you name
- Test asserting every captured miss in `real-misses.jsonl` still scores as a miss, so the saved fixtures now guard the scorer's normalization
- `--version` flag, read from `package.json` so it always matches the published release

### Fixed
- Audits no longer write a `tests/scorers/fixtures/` directory into the current working directory. Capture is off unless `--capture-misses` is passed
- Verdict no longer says "Switch to <model> - save ~$0.00/mo" when the only passing model is also the most expensive one. That case now reports that you are already on the optimal tier

### Changed
- Published package contains only the built CLI (4 files, ~10 kB, down from 43 files and ~272 kB)

## [1.0.0] - 9/22/26

### Added
- `pennywyze audit` command: benchmarks Claude Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku against a user-provided golden dataset
- Real cost projections and audit self-cost, built from actual token usage
- Strict, decoration-tolerant grading (exact-match scorer)
- Early stopping for tiers that mathematically can't pass
- `--fake` mode: full pipeline at zero cost, no API key required
- Installable globally via `npm install -g pennywyze`
